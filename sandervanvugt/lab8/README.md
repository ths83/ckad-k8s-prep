## Target
- Configure a service for the Nginx deployment you've created earlier. Ensure that the service makes Nginx accessible through port 80, using the ClusterIP type. Verify that it works.
- After making the service accessible this way, change the type to NodePort and expose the service on port 32000.
- Verify the service is accessible on this node port.
